# 🏝️ DesertIslandApps 🏝️

Which apps/libraries/packages would you take to a desert island? We share the softwares of our lives (and welcome contributions!).

This account is named after the BBC programme
[Desert Island Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr). We collect
awesome-like lists. Only, we call them differently!
